Inception v3 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture designed for image classification. It builds upon earlier versions of the Inception model by introducing factorized convolutions, batch normalization, and label smoothing to enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. With its 48 layers, Inception v3 is capable of achieving high performance on large datasets like ImageNet. The model is widely used in computer vision tasks due to its balance of accuracy and reduced computational cost.
